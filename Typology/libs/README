Libraries needed to run TypologyServer:

- Google GSON (http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/downloads/list)

- Neo4j Community Version >= 1.5 (http://neo4j.org/download/) 
  Notice that Neo4J supports automatic upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7 (just change libraries).
  From 1.4 to 1.5 and 1.5 to 1.6 you'll have to explicitly allow upgrade using ALLOW_UPGRADE flag
  in TypologyServer config file.

Libraries needed to run JUnit tests or test databases:

  - Neo4j Test Suite
    You can get "tests.jar" from here and put it into your build path:
